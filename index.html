        <p>HTML is the language used to create the web pages you visit everyday. It provides a logical way to structure content for web pages.
           Let's analyze the acronym "HTML", as it contains a lot of useful information. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
           A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.</p>

           <h3>CSS</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a
           document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages
           and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including
           plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media.

            <h3>Javascript</h3>
        </div>
        <p>JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted
           programming language. It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification.
           Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production;
           the majority of websites employ it.</p>
